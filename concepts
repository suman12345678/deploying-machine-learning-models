PATH and PYTHONPATH
===================
1. Update PATH where python installed in environment variable,
  after this you can type python and go into python terminal (doesnot matter where you present working directory in command prompt)
  if this is not done message 'python is not recognize as internal or external command'

  if python wants to look for module and packages from a project, update PYTHONPATH with that foldername

VIRTUALENV
==========
create virtual environment to maintain different version of package for different project. DO the below in command prompt or anaconde prompt
1. python -m venv demo_proj [venv is in standard library]
the above will create a folder in current dir, we can install pkg there only for that environment
2. demo_proj\Scripts\activate will activate
3. pip install numpy
4. deactive

GITHUB
======
1. install git and login to github
2. git config --global user.name suman12345678
3. git config --global user.email suman.ju06@gmail.com
4. git clone https://github.com/suman12345678/deploying-machine-learning-models.git ==> will create a local copy in current directory
5. to checkout any specifi commit: 
   login to the folder (deploying-machine-learning-models)
   git checkout  8d79cf4212c7f736a69b6c8d0128ef77232374ea
   so this will take the folder to initial some stage
6. git remote set-url origin https://github.com/suman12345678/deploying-machine-learning-models.git
pull request(set desktop with git url map before pushing)
a. git checkout -b test-branch-2
b. git commit --allow-empty -m "pull req"
c. git push origin test-branch-2

SETUP ML FRAMEWORK
==================
1. there is one setup.py we need to run that by below(Building the package, make sure you cd to root dir)
run command: python packages\regression_model\setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

2. we can install local packages : pip install -e packages\regression_model  (this will make the model importable)

Once both steps are done you can do: import regression_model;regression_model.__version__


MANIFEST.in file specify which directory we wish to include in our packages
